# React-Employee-Directory

The goal for this project was for me to get more familiar with React.  This is my first attempt at creating an application using React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
 
## Motivation

Practice React and break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.


## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.


## How to use? 

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category.

  * Filter the users by at Devloper property.

## Issues and future development

Currently the application works.  Would like to make some changes to the readme file, add a short video and some snapshot images.  I also would like to add some more sort features.  I would also like to add some CSS.
